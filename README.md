# Bisection-Modified-Secant-GUI-with-Javafx
HOW TO USE:
---------------------------------
It's very simple, enter the equation and the values of A, B and the tolerance. And click on which method you want your equation to be treated with.

Logic behind the code:
------------------------------------
There is nothing special, just using the refered methods rules and parsing the user input to double.
Note: the Modified-Secant may divrage so the code will enter in infite loop, that why I made the for loop stop at 10 iterations.
Both the methods are very samiler only the change in the Mid-Point rule which is referd with "C" in the code.
To eval the sting equation I used custom library exp4j, all right reserved to its respective owner.
If you want to edit in the code make sure to download it from here: https://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/ or from my repository.
and insde the project right click on directories tree and click ADD Jar/Folder and use it, the code shall work with no problems.

UPDATES:
------------------------------------
3/17/2018 added a modifed .java file to handle the user input error.

*Now the program won't accept any inputs unless it's vaild equation with vaild A,B values.
